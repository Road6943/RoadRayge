# RoadRayge
Fully customizable theme and graphics editor for [arras.io](https://arras.io/). Successor to TIGER by Road#6943 and Arras Graphics Client by Ray Adams. We worked together to combine both of our editors into RoadRayge, giving you the best of both worlds!

To provide feedback, message @road6943 or Road#6943 on Discord, or use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScu3JirmpF9YzDqP9JIZPJlGSsQDMEXnGtNY4zit7FaJgTpOg/viewform). You can also find me on the [Arras Theme Library Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DH2DP8JPhP)!

2. Once you have installed Tampermonkey, click [this link right here](https://github.com/Road6943/RoadRayge/raw/main/RoadRayge.user.js), and you should see a userscript-installation tab pop up. Click "Install" to do so.
3. Navigate to [arras.io](https://arras.io/), and you should see a gear icon on the top right. If so, then congrats! You've successfully installed the script!
4. If you do not see the gear icon in the top right, then you may need to disable your other Tampermonkey extensions (**especially TIGER**) by clicking on the Tampermonkey extension icon.
4. Enjoy!
