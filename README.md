# RoadRayge will shut down on March 22, 2024
Arras will get a built-in theme editor update for its 6th birthday on March 22, 2024. To migrate all your themes to the format used by the new theme editor, please upgrade your RoadRayge to the latest version by clicking this [link](https://github.com/Road6943/RoadRayge/raw/main/RoadRayge.user.js)

Once you have done so, please navigate to the Misc section and click the button labelled `Download All Themes In V1 Format` 

You can also convert individual themes with [this tool](https://codepen.io/cx88/pen/rNbVGmQ) made by CX!

Thank you for using TIGER and RoadRayge all these years. It has been wonderful seeing the themes you have all created, and I hope to see many more incredible themes with the launch of the new built-in theme editor!

# RoadRayge
Fully customizable theme and graphics editor for [arras.io](https://arras.io/). Successor to TIGER by Road#6943 and Arras Graphics Client by Ray Adams. We worked together to combine both of our editors into RoadRayge, giving you the best of both worlds!

To provide feedback, message @road6943 or Road#6943 on Discord, or use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScu3JirmpF9YzDqP9JIZPJlGSsQDMEXnGtNY4zit7FaJgTpOg/viewform). You can also find me on the [Arras Theme Library Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DH2DP8JPhP)!

**How to Install (Web):**
1. Install the Tampermonkey extension. [Click me](https://www.tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg) to view links to help you install Tampermonkey for your browser of choice.
2. Once you have installed Tampermonkey, click [this link right here](https://github.com/Road6943/RoadRayge/raw/main/RoadRayge.user.js), and you should see a userscript-installation tab pop up. Click "Install" to do so.
3. Navigate to [arras.io](https://arras.io/), and you should see a gear icon on the top right. If so, then congrats! You've successfully installed the script!
4. If you do not see the gear icon in the top right, then you may need to disable your other Tampermonkey extensions (**especially TIGER**) by clicking on the Tampermonkey extension icon.
4. Enjoy!

**How to Install (iOS Safari):**
1. Install the "Stay" app - https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stay-for-safari/id1591620171
2. Open "Stay" and click the button at the bottom that says "I am an experienced user, skip for now".
3. In the leftmost tab in "Stay", the one that says "Userscripts" at the top, click the `+` sign in the top right
4. Click "Link", and paste the url at the end of this bullet point. Feel free to dismiss the popup message asking you to watch a video, its not needed: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Road6943/RoadRayge/main/RoadRayge.user.js`
5. Once the link is pasted, click "Save" at the bottom and then "Create" at the top right to finish saving the userscript
6. When you're back at the Userscripts tab, click on your newly installed userscript
7. Change "Inject Mode" to "page", then use the button at the top left to return to the Userscripts tab
8. Open `arras.io` in a new Safari tab
9. Click `aA` in the left of the url bar, then click "Stay"
10. Select "Always Allow" then "Always Allow on **THIS** Website", not Every Website
11. Click Done, and now enjoy using RoadRayge on mobile!
12. If you want to make sure Stay doesn't have access to any other websites, go to `Settings > Safari > Extensions > Allow These Extensions > Stay`
13. For some users, RoadRayge will be very zoomed-in on Private Safari tabs but more zoomed-out on normal Safari tabs, so you can try both and see which you prefer.
